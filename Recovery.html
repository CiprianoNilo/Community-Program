<h3>RECOVERY</h3>
<p>A. The available support and services assistance is  to understand the unique needs and reactions of communities we serve, it is imperative to use disaster-specific information and resources during preparation, response, and recovery phases of disaster. The following resources cover a range of natural disasters, such as drought, earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and tornadoes. Also covered are human-caused disasters, such as technological disasters and terrorist attacks. These resources can be used by disaster behavioral health professionals, emergency planners, parents, teachers, first responders, and survivors to learn about the impacts of specific disasters, understand and manage reactions, enhance coping skills, and improve disaster plans.</p>
 
<p>B. The  site- restoration plans after a disaster rehabilitation into the disaster affected area must be taken with serious precautions.</p>
<p>They include:<p>
 <li>Ensuring safety of citizens by analysing weather reports in the future.</li>
  <li>A national emergency force must be stationed near the affected area at all times.</li>
  <li>Possible complications must be avoided by conducting mock drills for emergency evacuation.</li>
