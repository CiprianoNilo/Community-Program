<h3> INTRODUCTION </h3>

<h2>The Philippines is located in an area affected by natural disasters called the Ring of Fire or Typhoon Belt. This is because the Philippines is near the Pacific Ocean region where there are a great number of volcanic eruptions and earthquakes. These are the dangerous natural events that we are experiencing  in the Philippines: Typhoons, Volcanic eruptions, Earthquakes and Secondary effects.</h2>


<h4>Typhoons</h4>
<table>
<tr>
<tr>
<td style='text-align:center'>
Every year, 19 typhoons enter the Philippine region and about 7 or 8 make landfall. In the past, some have been extraordinarily powerful and 
caused casualties and the collapse of infrastructures in the affected area

The high frequency of earthquakes and typhoons also results in a number of secondary events to watch out for like floods and landslides. But our focus is on Typhoons  which are very evident in the Philippines especially in NCR. This emergency plan is to plan and prevent casualties whenever the natural disaster strikes and every individual has a role to play where we can help each other to prepare for emergencies or disasters in our Brgy. Pembo, Makati City.  With the help of The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council, in partnership with the Department of Local and Interior Government and SK Council, we can plan ahead and explain these segments:  mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery actions. </dd>
